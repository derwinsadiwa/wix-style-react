## Components

The following is a list of all the breaking changes made to the library's components. You can refer
to each component's documentation for a full overview.

### `<MessageBoxFixedHeaderFooter/>`

The component was removed.

### `<Card.CollapsedHeader/>`, `<Card.ButtonHeader/>`, `<Card.LinkHeader/>`

These deprecated component were completely removed in Version 6. You should use the `<Card.Header/>`
and the `<Collapse/>` components instead.

Refer to the [Card
story](https://wix-wix-style-react.surge.sh/?selectedKind=2.%20Layout&selectedStory=Card&full=0&addons=0&stories=1&panelRight=0)
for example usages.

##### For `<Card.CollapsedHeader/>`

Use the `<Collapse/>` component in combination with the `<Card.Content/>` component, like in the
following order:

```jsx
<Card>
  <Collapse>
    <Card.Content />
  </Collapse>
</Card>
```

##### For `<Card.ButtonHeader/>`

Use the `<Card.Header suffix={<Button/>} />` instead.

##### For `<Card.LinkHeader/>`

Use the `<Card.Header suffix={<TextLink/>} />` instead.

### `<Tag/>`

The component's margins has been updated according to the correct UX guidelines. The `useOldMargins`
prop has been removed and the new margins were applied by default.

### `<Text/>`

The deprecated `bold` prop has been removed in Version 6. You should use the newer `weight` prop,
like so:

- `<Text bold="false">` -> `<Heading weight="thin">`
- `<Text bold="true">` -> `<Heading weight="normal">`

In addition, the testkit method `isBold()` has been removed and should be now used as `getWeight()
=== 'normal'`.

### Importing from `Table/Toolbar`

The `src/Table/Toolbar` folder has been removed in Version 6. You should now import from
`wix-style-react/TableToolbar`. For example:

| Old import | New import |
| :--------- | :--------- |
| `import ... from 'wix-style-react/dist/src/components/Table/Toolbar/TableToolbar'` | `import ... from 'wix-style-react/TableToolbar'` |
| `import ... from 'wix-style-react/dist/src/components/Table/Toolbar'` | `import ... from 'wix-style-react/TableToolbar'` |

### `<InputWithOptions/>`

The following key press methods has been removed from the testkit. You should use the new
`keyDown()` method instead.

| Removed method | Usage with `keyDown()` |
| :------------- | :--------------------- |
| `pressDownKey()` | `keyDown('ArrowDown')` |
| `pressUpKey()` | `keyDown('ArrowUp')` |
| `pressAnyKey()` | `keyDown('Any')` |
| `pressEnterKey()` | `keyDown('Enter')` |
| `pressSpaceKey()` | `keyDown(' ')` |
| `pressTabKey()` | `keyDown('Escape')` |
| `pressEscKey()` | `keyDown('Tab')` |

### `<DataTable/>`

The deprecated `infoTooltip` prop has been removed in Version 6. Use the newer `infoTooltipProps`
prop instead.

In addition, the deprecated `newDesign` prop has been removed and its behaviour is now applies by
default.

### `<Table/>`

The deprecated `infoTooltip` prop has been removed in Version 6. Use the newer `infoTooltipProps`
prop instead.

### `<MessageBoxMarketerialLayout/>`

The `fixImagePosition` prop, which enabled a fixed image position, was removed in Version 6 and it's
behaviour in now true by default.

### `<TextField/>`, `<DropdownComposite/>`, `<TextArea/>`

All of these deprecated components were removed in Version 6. You should the newer `<FormField/>`
component instead.

- For `<TextField/>`, refer to [_3.1 TextField_](https://wix-wix-style-react.surge.sh/?selectedKind=3.%20Inputs&selectedStory=3.1%20Text%20Field&full=0&addons=0&stories=1&panelRight=0) updated documentation.
- For `<TextArea/>`, refer to [_3.2a Text Area_](https://wix-wix-style-react.surge.sh/?selectedKind=3.%20Inputs&selectedStory=3.2a%20Text%20Area&full=0&addons=0&stories=1&panelRight=0) updated documentation.
- For `<DropdownComposite/>`, refer to [_4.1 Dropdown_](https://wix-wix-style-react.surge.sh/?selectedKind=4.%20Selection&selectedStory=4.1%20Dropdown&full=0&addons=0&stories=1&panelRight=0) updated documentation.

### `<Dropdown/>`

Previously, the `selectedId` prop was used as hybrid of Controlled and Uncontrolled modes. You
could've update the `selectedId` (Controlled), but when an option is selected, it would immediately
set the state.

- If you have been using `<Dropdown/>` as a controlled component, you are good to go.
- If you were just using `selectedId` to set the initially selected option, then you need to pass
  the option id in the `initialSelectedId` prop instead.

### `<ButtonWithOptions/>`, `<IconWithOptions/>`

These deprecated components were removed in Version. Instead, you should use the newer
[`<DropdownBase/>`](https://wix-wix-style-react.surge.sh/?selectedKind=Components&selectedStory=DropdownBase&full=0&addons=0&stories=1&panelRight=0)
component, which provides a common dropdown mechanism that uses the `<Popover/>` component under the
hood in order to position the list in the best way possible. It and also manage keyboard navigation
out of the box and provides a straight forward API.

### `<Notification/>`

Previously, when `type` **was not** `global` and no `timeout` prop was passed, the notification
would be shown for 6 seconds before it was hidden. There was no way to make persistent notification
when `type` **was not** `global`.

In Version 6, the `<Notification/>` will always be persistent regardless of the provided `type`. You
should pass a timeout when you'd like to auto-close it.

- The `timeout` props was renamed to `autoHideTimeout`.
- If you expected the notification to be hidden after 6 seconds (just like the normal behaviour),
    you should pass `autoHideTimeout={Notification.DEFAULT_TIMEOUT}`

### TPA components

All of the TPA component has been removed from the library in Version 6.

### Backoffice components

The `<TextLink/>` and `<Tooltip/>` **Backoffice** components were removed from the library. You
should WSR's
[`<TextButton/>`](https://wix-wix-style-react.surge.sh/?selectedKind=5.%20Buttons&selectedStory=5.3%20TextButton&full=0&addons=0&stories=1&panelRight=0)
and
[`<Tooltip/>`](https://wix-wix-style-react.surge.sh/?selectedKind=7.%20Tooltips&selectedStory=7.1.%20Tooltip&full=0&addons=0&stories=1&panelRight=0)
components instead.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Misc

### Typography.scss

The old, deprecated typography classed and sass mixins was removed in version 6. Please use the
`<Heading/>` and `<Text/>` components or the [new typography
classes](../../stories/Typography/TypographyClassesMigration.md) instead of these classes when
possible.

### Polyfills

The deprecated testkits' polyfills were removed in Version 6. You should use the newer polyfills
located in `testkit/polyfills`.

| Old polyfill import | New polyfill import |
| :------------------ | :------------------ |
| `import polyfill from 'wix-style-react/Backoffice/Tooltip/CancelAnimationPolyfill.js'` | `import { requestAnimationFramePolyfill } from 'wix-style-react/testkit/polyfills'` |
| `import applyPolyfills from 'wix-style-react/DatePicker/Polyfills.js'` | `import { requestAnimationFramePolyfill } from 'wix-style-react/testkit/polyfills'` |
| `import polyfill from 'wix-style-react/utils/RangePolyfill.js'` | `import { rangePolyfill } from 'wix-style-react/testkit/polyfills'` |

The polyfills' usage has also been changed. While the old polyfills were installed when `import`ed,
the newer polyfills require you to install then manually, allowing better isolation. For example:

```js
import { rangePolyfill } from 'wix-style-react/testkit/polyfills';

beforeEach(() => {
  rangePolyfill.install();
});

afterEach(() => {
  rangePolyfill.uninstall();
});

// ...
```
