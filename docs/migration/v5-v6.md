`<Heading/>` and `<Text/>` components or the [new typography
classes](../../stories/Typography/TypographyClassesMigration.md) instead of these classes when
possible.

### Polyfills

The deprecated testkits' polyfills were removed in Version 6. You should use the newer polyfills
located in `testkit/polyfills`.

| Old polyfill import | New polyfill import |
| :-------------------- | :-------------------- |
| `import polyfill from 'wix-style-react/Backoffice/Tooltip/CancelAnimationPolyfill.js'` | `import { requestAnimationFramePolyfill } from 'wix-style-react/testkit/polyfills'` |
| `import applyPolyfills from 'wix-style-react/DatePicker/Polyfills.js'` | `import { requestAnimationFramePolyfill } from 'wix-style-react/testkit/polyfills'` |
| `import polyfill from 'wix-style-react/utils/RangePolyfill.js'` | `import { rangePolyfill } from 'wix-style-react/testkit/polyfills'` |

The polyfills' usage has also been changed. While the old polyfills were installed when `import`ed,
the newer polyfills require you to install then manually, allowing better isolation. For example:

```js
import { rangePolyfill } from 'wix-style-react/testkit/polyfills';

beforeEach(() => {
  rangePolyfill.install();
});

afterEach(() => {
  rangePolyfill.uninstall();
});

// ...
```
